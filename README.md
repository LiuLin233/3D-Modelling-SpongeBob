#  3D Modelling –SpongeBob

### 1  Introduction

The 3-dimensional scene simulates the Bikini Beach. The scene is mainly made of three kinds of buildings, colorful cars and a multi-expression SpongeBob. Three buildings are the Squid- ward’s head house, the pineapple house and the rock house respectively. Abundant opengl tech- niques are used to draw the scene, such as 3D modelling, light and materials, texture mapping and so on. There are also some keyboard inputs and mouse inputs to increase the interactiv-ity and fun of the application. The scene can be seen from different views and some typical screenshots are also contained below to show the program in action.

### 2  Graphic Features
